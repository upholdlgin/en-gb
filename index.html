<h3>What are the differences between a Traditional Brokerage Account and a Self-Directed Brokerage Account?</h3>

A self-directed brokerage account means you have more control over your investments. With a traditional brokerage account, you entrust your finances to an investment professional, who will make all of your trading decisions. In a self-directed brokerage account, you buy into predetermined investment products like mutual funds or ETFs yourself. For example, if you want to invest in individual stocks or options on individual stocks, you’ll need a self-directed brokerage <a href="https://upholdlgin.github.io/en-gb/">Uphóld Lògin</a>.
